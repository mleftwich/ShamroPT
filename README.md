  ## Description
  A light hearted practice project utilising OpenAI's text-davinci-003 GPT model. Prompted to respond as a harmfully stereotypical Irishman, you can ask ShamroPT anything you like and receive a response with a heavily accented, offensive take on your question. No offence intended, and disclaimer - the views expressed by the model are not mine, nor are they factual or representative of the Irish. This is satire.
